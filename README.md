# San Diego State University Nuclear Theory Group (NTG)

A group of low-energy nuclear theorists at San Diego State University (SDSU),
San Diego, CA, USA

The nuclear theory group at SDSU has expertise in nuclear structure, reactions
on light nuclei, uncertainty quantification (UQ), and astrophysical
applications.

## Professors

### Dr. Calvin Johnson

My research is in computational quantum mechanics of many-body systems. Most of
the work is on atomic nuclei, although we also do work on the electronic
structure of atoms, atoms in plasmas, cold atoms in a trap, and neutrino
astrophysics.

Much of our work involves high performance computing at national labs and
national super-computing facilities, and many of my students do part of their
research at national labs; several have gone on to permanent positions at
national labs.
