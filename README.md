# San Diego State University Nuclear Theory Group (NTG)

The SDSU-NTG is group of low-energy nuclear theorists at San Diego State
University (SDSU), San Diego, CA, USA. This page was created by one of its PhD
students, Oliver Gorton. The purpose of this page is purely informational, and
is unaffiliated with SDSU or any of its Faculty, Staff, or Students.

The nuclear theory group at SDSU has expertise in nuclear structure, reactions
on light nuclei, uncertainty quantification (UQ), and astrophysical
applications.

## Professors

These are the professors conducting research in nuclear theory at SDSU.

* Dr. Calvin Johnson
* Dr. Rodrigo Navarro-Perez
* Dr. Kenneth Nollett
* Dr. Fridolin Weber

## Codes

The group specializes in computational methods and has released a number of
open-source software packages.

### (BIGSTICK)[https://github.com/cwjsdsu/BigstickPublick]
An advanced nuclear shell model code.

### (DMFortFactor)[https://github.com/ogorton/dmfortfactor]
A code for computing WIMP-nucleus form factors.

### (Wigner)[https://github.com/ogorton/wigner]
