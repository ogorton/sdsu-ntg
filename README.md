The SDSU-NTG is group of low-energy nuclear theorists at [San Diego State
University](https://www.sdsu.edu) (SDSU), San Diego, CA, USA. This page was
created by one of its PhD students, Oliver Gorton. The purpose of this page is
purely informational, and is unaffiliated with SDSU or any of its Faculty,
Staff, or Students.

The nuclear theory group at SDSU has expertise in nuclear structure, reactions
on light nuclei, uncertainty quantification (UQ), and astrophysical
applications.
